# Hi, I'm Nashif 👋  

I'm a web developer who enjoys coding, breaking things, fixing them again, and learning something new in the process.  
I’m passionate about **coding, design, and learning how things actually work behind the scenes**.            
I like experimenting with projects, exploring ideas, and turning curiosity into code.  

## I mostly work with:
- JavaScript  
- React  
- Node.js & Express  
- MongoDB  
- HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS  
- A bit of Python on the side  

## Most of my repositories are:
- learning experiments  
- small ideas that became projects  
- projects that taught me *why things didn’t work the first time*
